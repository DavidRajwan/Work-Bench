# Data Exploration through Visual Representations

This project focuses on exploring data through visual representations using Python and the libraries Matplotlib and Plotly.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main sections:

1. Generating Data
2. Downloading Data
3. Working with APIs

Each section involves different data exploration techniques and visualizations.

## Generating Data

In the "Generating Data" section, we cover the following topics:

1. Plotting a Simple Line Graph: Visualizing a basic line graph using Matplotlib.
2. Mapping Random Walks: Creating visual representations of random walk data.
3. Probabilities of Generating Numbers: Visualizing the probabilities of generating numbers by rolling different amounts of dice.

## Downloading Data

The "Downloading Data" section focuses on working with different data sources. It includes:

1. Parsing CSV File Formats: Processing and visualizing data stored in CSV files.
2. Mapping Global Data Sets: Visualizing global data sets, such as earthquakes, using JSON format.

## Working with APIs

In the "Working with APIs" section, we explore interacting with web APIs. It covers:

1. Using a Web API: Accessing data from a web API and visualizing it.
2. Visualizing Repositories: Creating visual representations of repositories using Plotly.
3. Interacting with the Hacker News API: Accessing and visualizing data from the Hacker News API.

## Usage

To run the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in `venv` module:
    ```shell
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```shell
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```shell
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd project_directory
    ```
7. Run the scripts (example):
    ```shell
    python eq_explore_data.py
    ```
