# DIY Lightsaber Project

###DIY Lightsaber

Welcome to the DIY Lightsaber project repository! This repository showcases my journey in creating a custom lightsaber from scratch. I started by sketching my designs on paper, then utilized SolidWorks for CAD modeling. I 3D-printed my hilt designs and proceeded to sand and paint them to perfection. After that, I compiled the electronic parts, soldered them together following my custom wiring diagram, and assembled all the components. Finally, I created my own custom configurations, blade styles, and sound fonts, and flashed the Proffie board with the new software and configuration. This README will provide an overview of the project and guide you through the repository's contents.

## Project Description

The DIY Lightsaber project chronicles my hands-on experience in creating a unique lightsaber by employing various creative techniques. From initial sketches on paper to precise CAD modeling in SolidWorks, I meticulously crafted the design for the hilt. Leveraging 3D printing technology, I materialized my designs into tangible objects. Afterward, I dedicated time to sanding and painting the hilts, ensuring an immaculate finish.

The electronic aspect involved compiling the necessary components and soldering them together according to my custom wiring diagram. The comprehensive diagram enabled smooth assembly and precise connections. Combining the hilt, electronics, and Proffie board, I meticulously assembled all the parts, ensuring a seamless integration.

To add a personal touch to the lightsaber, I dove into the realm of custom configurations and blade styles. By exploring the capabilities of the Proffie board, I developed unique and captivating blade effects and sound fonts, providing an unparalleled lightsaber experience. Finally, I flashed the Proffie board with the new software and configuration, completing the transformation of my creation into a fully functional lightsaber.

This repository serves as a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship and creativity involved in the process of building a lightsaber from scratch.

The DIY Lightsaber project aims to provide viewers with an overview of the work I did to build my own lightsaber from scratch. The primary components used in this project are the Proffie board, which allows for customizable blade and sound configurations, and hilt designs created using SolidWorks.

The repository contains code, hilt designs, and a wiring diagram to help users understand and replicate the process of creating their own lightsaber. Whether you are a Star Wars fan, a cosplayer, or simply enjoy electronics and DIY projects, this repository will serve as an excellent resource. Hopefully this will provide enthusiasts with a guide on building their own lightsaber from scratch.

## Features

- Customizable blade styles and sound effects using the Proffie board.
- Hilt designs created with SolidWorks, providing unique and personalized options.
- Comprehensive wiring diagram for simplified assembly of the Proffie board.
- Easy-to-follow documentation for each component of the lightsaber.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Work-Bench/Proffie.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have the necessary tools and software installed, such as SolidWorks for hilt design and Arduino IDE for programming the Proffie board. More resources provided below.
3. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and documentation provided in the repository.

## Usage

The repository is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- `ProffieOS`: Contains the code for programming the Proffie board.
- `Hilts`: Includes the SolidWorks renderings for various hilt designs.
- `Wiring`: Contains the wiring diagram to assist in the assembly of the Proffie board.
- `documentation`: Additional documentation and resources to help you throughout the project.

Refer to the documentation within each directory for detailed instructions on using the respective files.

## Hilt Designs

The `Hilts` directory includes a variety of hilt designs I created using SolidWorks. Each design is provided as a separate render, allowing you to choose the one that appeals to you the most. Feel free to use those images as inspiration for your own design. 

## Proffie OS

The `ProffieOS` directory includes the firmware used to flash the proffie board in order to customize the blade styles and sound fonts.
The configs folder holds all of the custom configurations for the blade styles and the ProffieOS.ino file is used for flashing. 

## Wiring Diagram

The `Wiring` directory contains a comprehensive wiring diagram that illustrates the connections required for the Proffie board assembly. This diagram will guide you through the process of wiring the components correctly, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free build.
