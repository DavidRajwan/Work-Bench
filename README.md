# Home Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of my home projects, including coding games, robots, and experimentation with various programming languages. It serves as a showcase of my personal projects and a way to document my progress and learning journey.

## Projects

### Project 1: Game Based on "Python Crash Course" Book

The first project uploaded to this repository is a game based on the book "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes (2nd Edition). The book is a comprehensive guide that introduces programming concepts using Python and provides practical examples and projects.

#### Description

The game developed for this project is inspired by the book's project-based approach and aims to apply the concepts and techniques learned throughout the chapters. It serves as an interactive demonstration of my understanding and implementation of the concepts covered in the book.

#### Features

- **Game Title**: Alien Invasion
- **Game Description**: Top down space shooter
- **Key Features**:
  - Destroy as many aliens as possible
  - 3 Lives
  - Various difficulty

#### Usage

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in `venv` module:
    ```shell
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```shell
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```shell
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required dependencies, including Pygame:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd project_directory
    ```
7. Run the game:
    ```shell
    python alien_invasion.py
    ```
